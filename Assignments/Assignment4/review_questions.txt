Question 1: 
The expression reads a char and compare to EOF constant.
First it says that char is not c, and second compares with EOF.

Question 2:
Because int can store more than 256 characters, EOF inclusive.
But char can't store more than 256 characters.

Question 3:
++x: incrementation happens before any other operation.
x++: incrementation happens after other operations.

Question 4:
i++ is equal to i = i + 1
So the expression i = i++ could be written like this: i = i = i + 1
It looks like a waste of code, because first says i = i; and then says i = i + 1;
So i++ would be enough.
 
Question 5:
String is an array of characters + a null character ('\0')

Question 6:
At first everything will be normal, so a,bc will be placed and when EOF is read loop will break. 
But from now, c will be EOF, so function will not return EOF but break with \0.
